# RxDB – The Ultimate Offline Database with Sync and Encryption

When building modern applications, a reliable **offline database** can make all the difference. Users need fast, uninterrupted access to data, even without an internet connection, and they need that data to stay secure. **RxDB** meets these requirements by providing a **local-first** architecture, **real-time sync** to any backend, and optional **encryption** for sensitive fields.

In this article, we'll cover:
- Why an **offline database** approach significantly improves user experience
- How RxDB’s **sync** and **encryption** features work
- Step-by-step guidance on getting started

## Why Choose an Offline Database?

[Offline-first](../offline-first.md) or **local-first** software stores data directly on the client device. This strategy isn’t just about surviving network outages; it also makes your application faster, more user-friendly, and better at handling multiple usage scenarios.

### 1. Zero Loading Spinners
Applications that call remote servers for every request inevitably show loading spinners. With an offline database, read and write operations happen locally—providing near-instant feedback. Users no longer stare at progress indicators or wait for server responses, resulting in a smoother and more fluid experience.

### 2. Multi-Tab Consistency
Many websites mishandle data across multiple browser tabs. In an offline database, all tabs share the same local datastore. If the user updates data in one tab (like completing a to-do item), changes instantly reflect in every other tab. This removes complex multi-window synchronization problems.

### 3. Real-Time Data Feeds
Apps that rely on a purely server-driven approach often show stale data unless they add a separate real-time push system (like websockets). Local-first solutions with built-in replication essentially get real-time updates “for free.” Once the server sends any changes, your local offline database updates—keeping your UI live and accurate.

### 4. Reduced Server Load
In a traditional app, every interaction triggers a request to the server, scaling up resource usage quickly as traffic grows. Offline-first setups replicate data to the client once, and subsequent local reads or writes do not stress the backend. Your server usage grows with the amount of data—rather than every user action—leading to more efficient scaling.

### 5. Simpler Development: Fewer Endpoints, No Extra State Library
Typical apps require numerous REST endpoints and possibly a client-side state manager (like Redux) to handle data flow. If you adopt an offline database, you can replicate nearly everything to the client. The local DB becomes your single source of truth, and you may skip advanced state libraries altogether.

## Introducing RxDB – A Powerful Offline Database Solution

**RxDB (Reactive Database)** is a **NoSQL** JavaScript database that lives entirely in your client environment. It’s optimized for:

- **Offline-first usage**
- **Reactive queries** (your UI updates in real time)
- **Flexible replication** with various backends
- **Field-level encryption** to protect sensitive data

You can run RxDB in:
- **Browsers** ([IndexedDB](../rx-storage-indexeddb.md), [OPFS](../rx-storage-opfs.md))
- **Mobile hybrid apps** ([Ionic](./ionic-database.md), [Capacitor](../capacitor-database.md))
- **Native modules** ([React Native](../react-native-database.md))
- **Desktop environments** ([Electron](../electron-database.md))
- **Node.js** [Servers](../rx-server.md) or Scripts 

Wherever your JavaScript executes, RxDB can serve as a robust offline database.

## Quick Setup Example

Below is a short demo of how to create an RxDB [database](../rx-database.md), add a [collection](../rx-collection.md), and observe a [query](../rx-query.md). You can expand upon this to enable encryption or full sync.

```ts
import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb/plugins/core';
import { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';

async function initDB() {
  // Create a local offline database
  const db = await createRxDatabase({
    name: 'myOfflineDB',
    storage: getRxStorageDexie()
  });

  // Add collections
  await db.addCollections({
    tasks: {
      schema: {
        title: 'tasks schema',
        version: 0,
        type: 'object',
        primaryKey: 'id',
        properties: {
          id: { type: 'string' },
          title: { type: 'string' },
          done: { type: 'boolean' }
        }
      }
    }
  });

  // Observe changes in real time
  db.tasks
    .find({ selector: { done: false } })
    .$ // returns an observable that emits whenever the result set changes
    .subscribe(undoneTasks => {
      console.log('Currently undone tasks:', undoneTasks);
    });

  return db;
}
```

Now the `tasks` collection is ready to store data offline. You could also [replicate](../replication.md) it to a backend, encrypt certain fields, or utilize more advanced features like conflict resolution.


## How Offline Sync Works in RxDB

RxDB uses a [Sync Engine](../replication.md) that pushes local changes to the server and pulls remote updates back down. This ensures local data is always fresh and that the server has the latest offline edits once the device reconnects.

**Multiple Plugins** exist to handle various backends or replication methods:
- [CouchDB](../replication-couchdb.md) or **PouchDB**
- [Google Firestore](./firestore-alternative.md)
- [GraphQL](../replication-graphql.md) endpoints
- REST / [HTTP](../replication-http.md)
- **WebSocket** or [WebRTC](../replication-webrtc.md) (for peer-to-peer sync)

You pick the plugin that fits your stack, and RxDB handles everything from conflict detection to event emission, allowing you to focus on building your user-facing features.

```ts
import { replicateRxCollection } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication';

replicateRxCollection({
  collection: db.tasks,
  replicationIdentifier: 'tasks-sync',
  pull: { /* fetch updates from server */ },
  push: { /* send local writes to server */ },
  live: true // keep them in sync constantly
});
```

## Securing Your Offline Database with Encryption
Local data can be a risk if it’s sensitive or personal. RxDB offers [encryption plugins](../encryption.md) to keep specific document fields secure at rest.

#### Encryption Example

```ts
import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb/plugins/core';
import { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';
import { wrappedKeyEncryptionCryptoJsStorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/encryption-crypto-js';

async function initSecureDB() {
  // Wrap the Dexie storage with crypto-js encryption
  const encryptedStorage = wrappedKeyEncryptionCryptoJsStorage({
    storage: getRxStorageDexie()
  });

  // Create database with a password
  const db = await createRxDatabase({
    name: 'secureOfflineDB',
    storage: encryptedStorage,
    password: 'myTopSecretPassword'
  });

  // Define an encrypted collection
  await db.addCollections({
    userSecrets: {
      schema: {
        title: 'encrypted user data',
        version: 0,
        type: 'object',
        primaryKey: 'id',
        properties: {
          id: { type: 'string' },
          secretData: { type: 'string' }
        },
        required: ['id'],
        encrypted: ['secretData'] // field is encrypted at rest
      }
    }
  });

  return db;
}
```

When the device is off or the database file is extracted, `secretData` remains unreadable without the specified password. This ensures only authorized parties can access sensitive fields, even in offline scenarios.
